# VIA for Preonic

Based on the default keymap. Due to limited EEPROM space only one base layer is used (QWERTY [0]), this can later be adjusted in VIA.

It is still possible to use the custom keycodes `BACKLIT`, `LOWER` [1], and `RAISE` [2] to also reach the `ADJUST` [3] LAYER. The keycodes probably differ but are shown in via with the default config. The keycodes ar3e used on a Preonic rev1:

-   `LOWER`: 0x5D29
-   `RAISE`: 0x5D2A
-   `BACKLIT`: 0x5D2B
